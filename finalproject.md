## Final Project

Due: Friday December 9th, 11:59pm

The end-of-term project will involve producing a tool that ones classmates, TA, and professor can run to perform some analysis, visualization, transformation, or other service, with no direct communication with the submitters. This project consists of a demonstration of the reproducible (and thus, documented) tool you've been developing, and a summary of group member contributions.

The following are requirements for the end of term project:

### Reproducible tool

There is a document (through documentation tools like roxygen, sphinx, or gh-pages and markdown, for example) which walks the user through the process of setting up and running their docker-contained tool with provided demo data. Requires:
  1. docker container
  2. web-viewable docker container usage instructions
  3. (if applicable) web-viewable web service usage instructions
  4. demo data (downsampled to <5 min run time)
  5. expected results contained within documentation

If all of these cannot be completed, prioritize creating a web service that is standing up and provide a link to the intended starting page for our walkthrough. Successful usage of this documentation by students, TA, and professor, each result in 1 point.

### Contributions

Each group member must submit an **additional** group feedback form upon project submission. This means that there will be **two feedback submissions** in the final week: the regular form, as well as the project feedback form. Requires:
  1. fill out the [project feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/DZmQWPhtIzuxScUw2).

this is worth 1 point. If group members contributed significantly less to the final project than others, the grades will be weighted accordingly.

### The final point

You need to test other teams work. Requires:
 1. please fill out the [linked form](https://goo.gl/forms/8lDmfIpNy30vUUH82) for each team you test (i.e. you should fill this out twice if there are three teams total).
 
 If you do not complete all necessary tests by exactly 1 week after the deadline you will lose this point.
