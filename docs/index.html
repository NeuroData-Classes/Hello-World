								    <p>In this year long course, students will work together in small teams to design, develop, and deploy a functioning tool for practicing brain scientists, either for accelerating research or augmenting the clinic. The first semester will focus on scoping the tool, including determining feasibility (for us in a year) and significance (for the targeted brain science community), as well as a statement of work specifying deliverables and milestones. The second semester will focus on developing the tool, getting regular feedback, and iterating, using the agile/lean development process.</p>
                                    <p>Recommended Course Background: numerical programming, familiarity or interest in neuroscience</p>

                                    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
                                    <p>Location: Maryland 30</p>
                                    <p>Instructor: Joshua Vogelstein</p>
                                    <p>TA: Eric Bridgeford</p>
                                    <p>Meetings: MW 3 - 415</p>
                                    <p>This course will provide 4 design-credits per semester, and will be a team-based year-long undertaking in data science and neuroscience. Students will be required to have some background in programming, statistics, and linear algebra, and should be willing to learn more. The goal of this year of work is to produce a tool that lowers the barrier to entry for or solves some previously unsolved computational neuroscience task. The software produced will be open-source under the Apache 2.0 licence, and must be reproducible (i.e. another can run it and recreate the findings documented/reported). </p>
                                    <h3>Session 1 (typically Monday)</h3>
                                    <p>In the first session (typically Monday, unless there is no class on Monday in which case it will be on Wednesday), students will meet with the professor and TA for a meeting in which each group will present their work of the previous week and establish goals for the next week. A single student from each group will present on a weekly basis using some easily-opened slide framework (google docs, reveal, etc). Each individual will have 4+ slides detailing the following:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>1 slide: The deliverables the student set out to complete from the previous week. There should be one bullet point per item, with a clear definition of done (DoD).</li>
                                        <li>1 slide: the fraction of each deliverable the student completed that were attempted.</li>
                                        <li>1+ slides: support that the deliverable attempted was completed successfully.</li>
                                        <li>1 slide: The deliverables the student will attempt the following week.</li>
                                    </ol> 
                                    <p>Students are expected to practice presenting as a group prior to Session 1 each week.</p>

                                    <h3>Session 2 (typically Wednesday)</h3>
                                    <p>In the second session, the TA will be leading an activity or presenting a demo which will go into detail on a specific task or tool that the students will be able to make use of in their projects. Additionally, students will be required to provide a clear scoping of their weekly task, along with a clear definition of done (DoD) and detailed explanations of any pseudocode, simulations, etc that will be required.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                                    <p>This class communicates largely in Slack. Please join our Slack channel at <a href="http://spiralscience.slack.com/signup">spiralscience</a> to get involved.</p>
                                    <h3>Office Hours</h3>
                                    <p>The Wednesday sessions will function much like a lab (or office hours when we have no pressing topic to cover). If you wish to work with the TA, get help on something, etc. outside of these hours, send him a Google Calendar invite (if you don't have his gmail address ask him via Slack) with the following information:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Date + Time set</li>
                                        <li>Title of event as "Meeting with <yourgroupname>"</li>
                                        <li>Description of event enumerating all of the things you would like to cover within the meeting.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Grading</h3>
                                    <h5>Weekly</h5>
                                    <p>Each week students can earn up to 4 points across:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>deliverables (0 -> 1). A floating point value on the interval 0 and 1 depending on the portion (and quality) of deliverables produced each week.</li>
                                        <li>attendance, session 1: (0, .5, 1). A score of 1 will be awarded if the student is on time, a score of .5 if the student is late, and a score of 0 if the student does not attend. Students are required to attend all group sessions throughout the semester.</li>
                                        <li>attendance, session 2: (0, .5, 1). Same policy as above. Students are required to attend all lab sessions throughout the semester.</li>
                                        <li>completion of weekly partner evaluation: (0, .5, 1). A score of 1 will be awarded if the weekly evalution is submitted before 3 PM on Monday, a score of .5 if the weekly evaluation is submitted before 11:59 Monday, and a score of 0 if the student submits the evaluation at any other time/not at all.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h5>Midterm</h5>
                                    <p>On the 6th week of the semester, the students will be required to present their progress of their project as part of their midterm (TODO: number of points). The midterm should not be significantly more work than other weeks, and will consist of a demo and slide presentation detailing the current progress of the project. More details and an example will be provided as we approach the midterm date.</p>
                                    <h5>Final Project</h5>
                                    <p>The final project will follow a format similar to the midterm. More details will be available as we approach the end of the semester (TODO: add date).</p>
                                    <h3>Feedback</h3>
                                    <p>Students will do peer evaluations through the google form (linked below) prior to each feedback/planning session, evaluating themselves and their groupmates for the concluding week. Students will indicate which of their group members did attend the practice presentation session. The peer evaluation will also take the form of a PMF: each student will assign a floating point number to every group member, where the sum of all members contributions is 1. Individual grades will be weighted at the end of the term based on peer evaluation feedback, and to intervene throughout the semester if necessary. Students will also identify properties of the class which gruntle or disgruntle them, so that the prof and TA may make adjustments. If the peer evaluation is completed prior to the start of the feedback/planning session (same time as the deliverables) the student is given 1 point, otherwise, 0.</p>
