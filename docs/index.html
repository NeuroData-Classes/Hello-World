									<h2>About</h2>


								    <p>In this year long course, students will work together in small teams to design, develop, and deploy a functioning tool (or  augment an existing one) for practicing brain scientists, either for accelerating research or supporting clinical practice. The first semester will focus on scoping the tool, including determining feasibility (for us in a year) and significance (for the targeted brain science community), as well as a statement of work specifying deliverables and milestones. Students will produce a Minimum Viable Product (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>). The second semester will focus on developing the tool, getting regular feedback, and iterating, using the <a href="https://realtimeboard.com/blog/choose-between-agile-lean-scrum-kanban/">agile/lean</a> development process.</p>



																<p>This course is based on my experience as an academic, and entrepreneur, an advisor, and an instructor.  It is designed to be the best class you'll ever take.  You will  learn (by doing and getting feedback) the skills that I have found particularly useful in my endeavors. It will be organized into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">sprints</a>, loosely based on Agile software development practices.  Weekly progress will be reported documenting goals towards your team sprints, with sprint demo's to happen at the close of each sprint.  Each team will be graded jointly on the basis of meeting the sprint goals, as well as providing clear and concise weekly progress reports.
																</p>

																<p>The main "skills" you will learn in this class include:
																	<ul>
																		<li>How to choose a <bold>significant</bold> and <bold>feasible</bold> project.
																		<li>How to scope work so that you can achieve weekly progress towards quarterly goals.
																		<li>How to effectively communicate technical content.
																		<li>How to generate publication quality figures (see <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/checklists/blob/master/figures.md">figure checklist</a> for details).
																		<li>How to complete a wide set of data science tasks, spanning from data munging to statistical modeling.
																		<li>How to peacefully and productively work with a diverse team of passionate individuals.
																	</ul>
																</p>

										<h2>Course Requirements</h2>

										Admittance to this course requires approval from the instructor, to ensure the students in the course are sufficient diverse along a number  of dimensions.  To gain admittance, you must:
											<ol>
												<li>Be more <em>excited</em> about this course than any other academic endeavor for the year. Nobody is required to teach or take this course, and since so many people want to take it each year, preference is given to those that are most <bold>passionate</bold> about the material.
												<li>Because this course is based on team projects, I will approve entire teams all at once.  You can join the course slack channel <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/spiralscience/shared_invite/enQtMzQ3MzY2MzEwOTk3LWE0YzRmZjBhMDcyZGY1MGY5MDFjYWRhNjMxNzU1MzhkYjBlZTI2YWUwNWQ1NjRjOTQ3OGY0NDMyOGI3ODY5NGI">here</a> to chat with other potential team mates.
												<li>Send the CV and transcript of all members of your planned team to me for joint approval.
											</ol>


											<h2>Potential Projects</h2>


											Each team will develop or extend a tool to answer an important neurobiology question.  The question must require the development of a new tool to obtain a satisfactory answer; likewise, the tool must be able to answer the question.  Potential (though vague) neuroscience questions to answer:
											<ul>
												<li>Characterize the anatomical, genetical, and physiological diversity of synapses
												<li>Mitigate batch effects in human MRI derived connectomes
												<li>Build models of connectomes, potentially incorporating joint and individual variation
											</ul>

											Ideally the tools that we build will be extensions/modifications of already popular tools that we contribute to developing, including:
											<ul>
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/R-RerF">Randomer Forest (RerF)</a> for nonparametric regression and classification.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/lol">Linear Optimal Low-rank projection (LOL)</a> performs efficient  dimensionality reduction.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/mgc">Multiscale Graph Correlation (MGC)</a> statistical testing for potentially high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndmg">NeuroData's MRI to Graphs (ndmg)</a> for analysis and statistcs of MRI derived connectomes.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndreg">NeuroData's Registration (ndreg)</a> for nonlinear 3D image registration.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndpull">NeuroData's Pull (ndpull)</a>  to download data from our spatial database.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndpush">NeuroData's Push (ndpush)</a> to put data into our spatial database.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndwebtools">NeuroData's Web Tools (ndweb)</a> to coordinate, track, and manage all the data in our spatial databases.
												<li><a href="https://github.com/google/neuroglancer">Neuroglancer</a> is a WebGL-based viewer for volumetric data. It is capable of displaying arbitrary (non axis-aligned) cross-sectional views of volumetric data, as well as 3-D meshes and line-segment based models (skeletons).
												<li><a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume">Cloud Volume</a>: a client for reading and writing to Neuroglancer Precomputed volumes on cloud services.
											</ul>

																		<h3>Assignments</h3>

																		There will be four main assignments due over the course of the year. In each case, the instructor will provide you with successful examples.
																		<ol>
																			<li><bold>Sprint 0: August 30 - September 30th.</bold> In the first month of class you will scope a feasible and significant project for the year with your team members, consulting the instructor and reading background literature to establish a <bold>gap</gap> that you can fill.  The Statement of Work for this sprint will include:
																				<ul>
																				<li>A 2-page description of your project for the year,  so be submitted to AWS as a research grant to get AWS credits for the year for your project. See  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/">here</a> for details.
																				<li>A statement of work listing the deliverables for each of the subsequent three sprints during the semester.  This statement of work will include a 1-paragraph description of the work per sprint, as well as a clear and concise enumerated list of milestones with appropriate performance metrics.  It will require a detailed graphical description (e.g., a figure) providing an example of both the qualitative and quantitative evaluation procedures that you will be using for the duration of the course.
																				<li>A "pitch deck" to be presented to the class
																			</ul>
																			<li><bold>Sprint 1: October 1 - December 12.</bold> In Sprint 1 you will build a minimal viable product (MVP).  This will take the form of a lightly documented code repository containing a tool that early adopters could adopt to solve their problems.  The deliverables will include:
																				<ul>
																					<li>A "nature compliant" github repo containing everything required by Nature (see <a href="nature_checklist.png">here</a> for details, or <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/lol">here</a> for an example).
																					<li>A website for the tool, at a minimum, containing links to code, docs, and demo notebooks/vignettes.
																					<li>A presentation during our final (as scheduled by registrar) presenting the motivation, challenge, action, and result of your work. This presentation will document the degree to which you have achieved all the goals established for Sprint 1 during Sprint 0. It will also include publication quality figures, both qualitative and quantitative ones.
																					<li>A live demo during the final showcasing the primary functionality of the tool.
																					</ul>
																			<li><bold>Sprint 2: January 28 - March 15.</bold> In Sprint 2 you will update your MVP to approach the final goals of the year in terms of functionality, performance, and usability.   The deliverables will include:
																				<ul>
																					<li>Comprehensive user documentation and testing.
																					<li>A presentation (up to an hour, including questions) on the week of Mar 10 to the class, during which you will report on your progress, presenting your documentation, testing, and qualitative and quantitative figures demonstrating the improvements over the course of the semester.
																					<li>A live demo during your presentation demonstrating the improvements you've made during Sprint 2.
																					<li>A coherent plan to acquiring and incorporating feedback and application of your tool to answer a real neurobiological question.
																				</ul>

																				<li><bold>Sprint 3: March 25 - May 8.</bold> In Sprint 3 you will finalize your product in preparation for its official release. This will include the following:
																					<ul>
																						<li>The tool will be on an appropriate package manager (e.g., CRAN, PyPi, etc.), if appropriate
																						<li>A pull request of yours to incorporate your addition to the master branch of a community project will be merged (or we will decide that the reason the master did not merge was not interesting, and we will "publish" our fork).
																						<li>A final presentation to potentially interested parties including neurobiologists from around JHU and potentially other places, including a sustainability plan.
																						<li>A live demo during your presentation demonstrating the final product.
																					</ul>

																		</ol>


																		<h3>Credits</h3>



																		<p>This course will provide 4 design-credits per semester, and will be a team-based year-long undertaking in data science and neuroscience. The 2xx level does not require extensive numerical programming, and is designed for underclass persons to learn about the design process by contributing in a variety of ways to the teams progress, and includes written assignments.  The 4xx level is designed for upperclass persons, counts for 4-credits of design per semester in BME.  Each team will have a team captain who is required to take the 6xx level, and will have additional requirements. Students in the 4xx level and above will be expected to have some background in programming, statistics, and linear algebra, and should be willing to learn more. The goal of this year of work is to produce a tool that lowers the barrier to entry for or solves some previously unsolved computational neuroscience task. The software produced will be open-source under the Apache 2.0 licence, and must be reproducible (i.e. another can run it and recreate the findings documented/reported).
																		</p>


																		<h3>Weekly Class Organization</h3>

																		This is subject to change, pending the feedback from the course participants. The current plan is as follows: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays will all follow the same basic structure:
																		<ul>
																			<li>Minutes 1-15 of class jovo will provide a short lecture/tutorial on a topic of mutual interest.
																			<li>Minutes 15-45  Team A will make a formal presentation to the class, tactfully accepting constructive criticism and feedback..
																			<li>Minutes 45-75 Team B informally reports on mid-week progress to jovo, with actual code/figures/deliverables in place.
																		</ul>

																		The weekly schedule will be: Monday: Team 1=A and 2=B,  Wednesdays: Team 2=A and 3=B, Fridays: Team 3=A and 1=B.

																		The above schedule means that each team presents informally 5 days after committing to a plan, and formally 7  days after.

																		The formal presentations will take the following form: students from the group will present google slides. Each team member will have about 3+ slides detailing the following:
                                    <ol>
																				<li>1 slide: The sprint and weekly goals, each color coded to denote the degree of completion.
                                        <li>1 slide per task: data (limited to: figures, tables, demos, or webpages) that the deliverable attempted was completed successfully, with links. Note that the content on the slide should include incontrovertible evidence of talk completion, i.e., stating "i did it" and/or linking to code that you claim does the job is insufficient.</li>
                                        <li>1 slide: The deliverables the student will attempt the following week.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>Students are expected to practice presenting as a group prior to Session 1 each week. See these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UrrILP06medc4dXGiW0ctTGVN5w0y1x0x5VrXrSh22c/edit?usp=sharing">example slides</a>. </p>



																		The informal presentations will take the following form: each student from the group will present google slides with the following:
																		<ol>
                                        <li>1 slide per task: data (limited to: figures, tables, demos, or webpages) that the deliverable attempted was completed successfully, or will be by next class, with links. Note that the content on the slide should include incontrovertible evidence of talk completion, i.e., stating "i did it" and/or linking to code that you claim does the job is insufficient.</li>
                                        <li>1 slide: The planned deliverables for the following week.</li>
                                    </ol>

																		During the informal presentation, jovo will provide detailed feedback on how to improve the results or plans.


                                    <p></p>


                                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                                    <p>This class communicates largely in Slack. Please join our Slack channel at <a href="http://spiralscience.slack.com/signup">spiralscience</a> to get involved. Regular updates are provided in Slack, and the instructors will assume you have recieved them.</p>
                                    <h3>External Help</h3>
                                    <p>Jovo and TA are typically available after class to provide feedback/guidance as requested.

                                    <h3>Contributing</h3>

																		Each team will have:
																		<ol>
                                        <li>A github repo containing all the code and other content for the course (possibly graduating to multiple repo's as appropriate).
                                        <li>A slack channel on the team workspace.
																				<li>A google drive folder containing the weekly slides (and jovo has edit permissions).
                                    </ol>

																		It is expected that each team member participates in each of the above three media.


                                    <h3>Grading</h3>
                                    <h4>Weekly</h4>
                                    <p>Each week students will be graded on the degree of completion of their deliverables.  Sprint deadlines will be up-weighted.  Weekly feedback from jovo on grades will be provided.  </p>


                                    <h3>Feedback</h3>

                                    <p>Steven Covey, author of "Seven Habits", states that the 7th habit is "sharpening our sword", which means (for this class), getting feedback and seriously considering it. Every person involved in the class will therefore be required to provide feedback to others, including the instructor.   Students will also identify properties of the class which gruntle or disgruntle them, so that we may make adjustments.  <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/dLUS48mniPKhGcyj1">Link to Peer Evaluation</a>.
