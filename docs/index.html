								    <p>In this year long course, students will work together in small teams to design, develop, and deploy a functioning tool for practicing brain scientists, either for accelerating research or augmenting the clinic. The first semester will focus on scoping the tool, including determining feasibility (for us in a year) and significance (for the targeted brain science community), as well as a statement of work specifying deliverables and milestones. The second semester will focus on developing the tool, getting regular feedback, and iterating, using the agile/lean development process.</p>
                                    <p>Recommended Course Background: numerical programming, familiarity or interest in neuroscience</p>

                                    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
                                    <p>Location: Wyman 400 (BME Suite) unless stated otherwise below in the Schedule or in the slack channel</p>
                                    <p>Instructor: Joshua Vogelstein</p>
                                    <p>TA: Eric Bridgeford</p>
                                    <p>Meetings: MW 3 - 415, F (typically optional, but see schedule below for details) 3 - 415</p>
                                    <p>This course will provide 4 design-credits per semester, and will be a team-based year-long undertaking in data science and neuroscience. Students will be expected to have some background in programming, statistics, and linear algebra, and should be willing to learn more. The goal of this year of work is to produce a tool that lowers the barrier to entry for or solves some previously unsolved computational neuroscience task. The software produced will be open-source under the Apache 2.0 licence, and must be reproducible (i.e. another can run it and recreate the findings documented/reported). </p>
                                    <h3>Session 1 (typically Monday)</h3>
                                    <p>In the first session (typically Monday, unless there is no class on Monday in which case it will be on Wednesday), students will meet with the professor and TA for a meeting in which each group will present their work of the previous week and establish goals for the next week. A single student from each group will present on a weekly basis using some easily-opened slide framework (google docs, reveal, etc). Each individual will have 4+ slides detailing the following:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>1 slide: The deliverables the student set out to complete from the previous week. There should be one bullet point per item, with a clear definition of done (DoD).</li>
                                        <li>1 slide: the fraction of each deliverable the student completed that were attempted.</li>
                                        <li>1+ slides: support that the deliverable attempted was completed successfully.</li>
                                        <li>1 slide: The deliverables the student will attempt the following week.</li>
					<li>Students should have NO MORE than 10 slides (approx 1 minute per slide, with 5 minutes for discussion).</li>
                                    </ol> 
                                    <p>Students are expected to practice presenting as a group prior to Session 1 each week.</p>
                                    <p>Weekly goals will be recorded on asana, and modified in session 2 as necessary following class time (due by 4:15 Wednesday).</p>
                                    <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UrrILP06medc4dXGiW0ctTGVN5w0y1x0x5VrXrSh22c/edit?usp=sharing">Example slides</a></p>
                                    <h3>Session 2 (typically Wednesday)</h3>
                                    <p>In the second session, we will focus on scoping out the weekly tasks. The purpose of this day is not to burden students with work from Monday to Wednesday; rather, the purpose is to ensure that we can give you feedback on your idea before you spend (potentially) a long time on it! Required will be a definition of done (DoD) for weekly goals identified at the Monday session, and detailed explanations of any pseudocode, simulations, etc that will be required to reach that DoD. The instructor and TA will give feedback, and a meeting with the TA will potentially be organized as necessary in case something is unclear or requires further explanation.</p>
                                    <p>Weekly goals will be updated with specific DoDs following wednesday class, with due dates for goal updates at 4:15 on Wednesday.</p>
                                    <h3>Session 3 (typically Friday)</h3>
                                    <p>This session will not be required for all students to attend. This session will be essentially office hours/lab, where at least for the first portion of the course, the TA will prepare review sessions of key tools (Github, docker, AWS, etc) along with hands-on tutorials to get the students' feet wet. Again, this session will be optional, but highly recommended, as the course will require proficiency with many tools that students might otherwise not be familiar with.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                                    <p>This class communicates largely in Slack. Please join our Slack channel at <a href="http://spiralscience.slack.com/signup">spiralscience</a> to get involved.</p>
                                    <h3>External Help</h3>
                                    <p>If you wish to work with the TA, get help on something, etc. outside of session 3, send him a Google Calendar invite (if you don't have his gmail address ask him via Slack) with the following information:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Date + Time set</li>
                                        <li>Title of event as "Meeting with <yourgroupname>"</li>
                                        <li>Description of event enumerating all of the things you would like to cover within the meeting.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>Contributing</h3>
                                    <p>Each team will need to maintain a git repo for all code associated with the course, as well as for weekly deliverables. This repo should be rigorously organized, as it will be an unacceptable weekly goal moving forward to reorganize or factor the repository, as that should be decided ahead of time before any code is produced. To simplify this process, we have introduced contributing requirements for your reference, which can be seen <a href="https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/Syllabus/blob/master/contributing.md">contributing.md</a>, and an example at <a href="https://github.com/neurodatadesign/template">template repo</a>. If you wish to propose any changes, let us know, but otherwise we will assume you will be following this spec to some degree.</p>
                                    <h3>Grading</h3>
                                    <h5>Weekly</h5>
                                    <p>Each week students can earn up to 4 points across:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>deliverables (0, .5, 1). Whether the student hit on the weekly goals or not. We will assign a score from 0 to 1 and round to the nearest half.</li>
                                        <li>attendance, session 1: (0, .5, 1). A score of 1 will be awarded if the student is on time, a score of .5 if the student is late or leaves early, and a score of 0 if the student does not attend. Students are required to attend all group sessions throughout the semester.</li>
                                        <li>attendance, session 2: (0, .5, 1). Same policy as above. Students are required to attend all session 2s throughout the semester.</li>
                                        <li>completion of weekly partner evaluation: (0, .5, 1). A score of 1 will be awarded if the weekly evalution is submitted before 3 PM on Monday, a score of .5 if the weekly evaluation is late, and a score of 0 if the student submits the evaluation after class ends Monday.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h5>Sprint Demos</h5>
				    <p>At the end of each sprint cycle, the students will be required to give a team presentation detailing their success (or failure) to meet each sprint goal. The presentation format will be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1 slide covering current sprint goals, color-coded by progress </li>
						<li>at a MINIMUM 1 slide per sprint goal, with action title and summary figure</li>
						<li>1 slide covering goals for the next sprint cycle</li>
					</ul>
				    <p>The students should be actively maintaining NATURE COMPLIANT repositories (example <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/mgc">here</a>), complete with a demo of relevant functionality. For a minimum example presentation, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZB4zL0Sos8Xzq4mcmfZaPCtylbECHGaLh2ZIx1pO4c/edit?usp=sharing">minimal presentation example</a>. Grading of sprints will be completely binary. A score of 0 will be awarded for each sprint goal that is either non-finished or non-demod. A score of 1 will be awarded for each sprint goal that is sufficiently completed (as determined by DoDs set in the first 2 weeks of each sprint cycle) and demod with sufficient documentation for reproduction by an unaffiliated 3rd party.</p>
                                    <h3>Feedback</h3>
                                    <p>Students will do peer evaluations through the google form (linked below) prior to each feedback/planning session, evaluating themselves and their groupmates for the concluding week. Students will indicate which of their group members did attend the practice presentation session. The peer evaluation will also take the form of a PMF: each student will assign a floating point number to every group member, where the sum of all members contributions is 1. Individual grades will be weighted at the end of the term based on peer evaluation feedback, and to intervene throughout the semester if necessary. Students will also identify properties of the class which gruntle or disgruntle them, so that the prof and TA may make adjustments. If the peer evaluation is completed prior to the start of the feedback/planning session (same time as the deliverables) the student is given 1 point, if by 11:59 that night .5 points, otherwise, 0.</p>
